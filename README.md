# audio-pilot

## Summary

This is a work-in-progress. When (or if) I complete it, it will automatically generate and play ambient music.

## Why?

I'm working on this hobby project to learn these technologies:
 * **TypeScript** to create a tree representation of a song
 * **Web Audio API** to play the song in the user's web browser
 * **AI (in some form)** to learn how to make a song the user likes
 * **Redux (maybe?)** to modify the tree representation of a song

## Usage

### Setup

```
npm install
```

### Run

```
npm run-script build
npm run-script serve
open http://localhost:8080
```

### Test

```
npm test
```
